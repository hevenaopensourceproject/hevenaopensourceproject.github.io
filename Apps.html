 <p> As you can see, Hevena OS ships with only a few system apps (Instagram and the Play Store are included in this example down below to show how third party icons are handled.). Let's go through a few of these apps.  </p>
            <img src="homescreem.png" alt="Home Screen 2nd time">
            <img src="VideoChatIcon.png" alt="Video Chat Icon">
            <p> Firstly, one of the apps I WILL NOT be going over is the Video Chat app. This is going to be a simple video calling app, but will very likely not be shipped because I don't have the server stuff and probably all of the other technical stuff to support it. This might be shipped in a future release, however.</p>
            <p> The first app we'll go over is the Music app.</p>
            <img src="MusicAppDrawing.png" alt="Music App">
            <p> As you can see, this is the basic outline of the music app. I haven't really drawn up more of the app, but this is the first page you'll be greeted with. At the top, you have a little info about what music you're playing currently or was playing previously. It also has a small arrow link to the controls. Along the bottom, there are different buttons to accesss your albums collection, artists, individual songs, and playlists that you can create.</p>
            <img src="Dialer-V2.png" alt="dialer">
            <p> The dialer is a very simple app. Just three pages are along the top - The dialer itself, your call history, and your list of contacts (referred to as "friends"). Other than that, you have a dialer pad, and a button to place the call.</p>
            <img src="IncomingCall.png" alt="Incoming Call UI">
            <p> The Screen you'll see when there is an incoming call. Swipe left to decline, or swipe right to answer.</p>
            <img src="InCallUI.png" alt="In-Call UI">
            <p> Say you answer that call, this is the screen you see. Sorry the UI color blends in with the page color. I'll be working on a fix for that soon.</p>
