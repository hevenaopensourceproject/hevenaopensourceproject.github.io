            <p> Welcome to the Hevena Open Source Project! Here you can learn more about and become a part of the most ambitious project ever to redefine the Android Operating system.</p>
            <p> This project initially started out as a way to blend the best qualities of both iOS and Android. Consumers love the simplicity of iOS and the flexibility of android - rooting, etc. This project still continues as such. The OS is still very much in it's android roots, with the normal flexibilities like installing any app you want from any source you want, the ability to root, and so on. However, it also contains the simplicity of certain aspects of iOS. A unified design element, stability, and fluidity will be major focus points of this Operating System. This initial code base will be android 7.0 "Nougat", and major OS upgrades will be provided about every 2 years.</p>
            <h1>Why Use Android Nougat? Why Only OTA every 2 Years?</h1>
            <img src="HevenaOSDevelopmentSchedule.png" alt="Development Schedule">
            <p> The downfall of many Android ROMs (Variants) is that they are often buggy. Once a year for most developers seems to be a push and many will forgo bug fixes and device optimization in favor of building a completely new android OS version instead. Hevena OS aims to take this level of stability and optimization to the next level. While the main Android version will only be upgraded every two years, it will recieve updates quite often. As stated by this chart, about every two months an update will be pushed to optimize the device for stability, speed, and battery life. At month 12, an update will be pushed out to focus on new features instead of mainly just fixing the code. The other updates will be dedicated to more bug fixes and security updates all the way until Month 24 when the cycle becomes complete. Also in Month 24, an updated Hevena OS will ship with a new android version, giving users the option to stay on a stable environment or one more on the cutting edge. Also, at the time of writing (August 2016), Android Nougat is the newest edition of Android, but if Hevena OS ever ships, the newest version will be used.</p>
